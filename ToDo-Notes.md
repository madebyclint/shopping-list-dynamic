1. ✅ **FIXED** - I want to add an audit butotn in the shopping list to double check against the weekly menu to make sure we didn't miss anything in meals or pantry.

2. we need the ability for two people who are editing or checking off items at the same time each other gets the update immediately

3. we need a json import/export that will allow me to export all data and import it into another instance or user and it will supplement not override the current data for weekly menus and shopping lists and ingredients. we should version this import/export mapping in case we need to change it in the future. also we need confirmation on both import and export. also we need security built it - escaping to prevent cross site scripting and injection.

4. ✅ **FIXED** - Shopping lists slow loading issue resolved. The AI parser has been disabled for performance (marked as deprecated). The most recent list now loads automatically on page refresh instead of showing the deprecated text-based edit form. Shopping list generation now uses basic price estimation instead of expensive AI processing for much faster loading times.

5. We need to be able to Edit/Delete shopping lists

6. The ingredients list needs to have all the grocery list items and show it's details including price, unit, category, and meal associated if possible. Anything else? Also I need to be able to remove duplicates and remap those duplicate items automatically if needed. Also the remove duplicates should also clean up naming (like orphaned json characters, spelling, casing, etc).
